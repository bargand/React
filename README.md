# Why React??
- we can use states which means that once we update the state variable , it can changes across the page.
- we can split our app into multiple components and reuse those components.
-React uses a vartual dom to efficiently update the UI which is better than updating content using DOM manupulation.
-Debugging and maintainance is easy
