Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Create Vite + React App


### First of all create your First Vite Project 

### `npm create vite@latest`

- Select your app name ----> Select React Library -----> select language ----> now you set your vite project
- One thing you need to remember is that the name of the main folder should not contain any special characters, an error may occur while running the app.
- You can use dot `.` instead of the project name, if you do that, the project files will be installed in the folder where you are.

## Now Run App Directory

- The name you gave while creating the Vite project it will be your app name 

### `cd app-name`

## Then install node-modules

### `npm install`

## Now you all set, and you will start your vite+react application

### `npm run dev`



# Why React??
- we can use states which means that once we update the state variable , it can changes across the page.
- we can split our app into multiple components and reuse those components.
-React uses a vartual dom to efficiently update the UI which is better than updating content using DOM manupulation.
-Debugging and maintainance is easy
